	Abstract = {Summary Selenium (Se) is a naturally occurring trace element that is essential for animal and human nutrition, but the range between dietary requirements and toxic levels is relatively narrow. In this review, we are interested in the beneficial effects of selenium and we report on a number of studies of the selenium status of different populations in Saudi Arabia. The Status reflectes the geographical area inhabited by the populations. Apart from the few available studies reviewed here, no data on the human status of Se in Saudi Arabia has been obteined. A further objective of this paper is throw some the light on the direction of future studies. },

@article{AN9952000841,
	Abstract = {The Se concentration of foods can be increased by supplementing fertilizers with soluble Se compounds. In Finland the availability of soil Se for plants is poor owing to the relatively low Se concentration{,} low pH and high iron content of the soil. Since 1984 multimineral fertilizers have been supplemented with Se (16 mg kg to fertilizers for grain production and 6 mg kg to those for fodder production) in the form of sodium selenate. Within two years a three-fold increase of mean Se intake was observed. The supplementation affected the Se content of all major food groups with the exception of fish. The concomitant human serum Se concentration increased by 70\%. In 1990 the amount of Se that was supplemented was reduced to 6 mg kg for all fertilizers. This reduced the mean Se intake by 30\% and the serum Se concentration decreased by 25\% from the highest levels observed in 1989. Plants take up part of the supplemented selenate and transform it into organic Se compounds{,} mainly selenomethionine. This affects human nutrition by increasing the Se content of foods of both animal and vegetable origin. According to data obtained in Finland{,} supplementation of fertilizers with Se is a safe and effective means of increasing the Se intake of both animals and humans that is feasible in countries with relatively uniform geochemical conditions. This kind of intervention requires careful monitoring of the effects on both animal and human nutrition and the environment.},

@article{Hamilton20041,
	Abstract = {In many environmental contaminant situations selenium has become the primary element of concern because of its bioaccumulative nature in food webs. Initial concerns about selenium were related to fish kills at Belews Lake, NC, Martin Lake, TX, and Kesterson Reservoir, CA, and to bird deformities at Kesterson Reservoir. Additional concerns were identified under the National Irrigation Water Quality Program at Salton Sea, CA, Kendrick, WY, Stewart Lake, UT, and Grand Valley and Uncompahgre Valley, CO. Recent studies have raised concerns about selenium impacts on aquatic resources in Southeastern Idaho and British Columbia. The growing discomfort among the scientific community with a waterborne criterion has lead the \{US\} Environment Protection Agency to consider a tissue-based criterion for selenium. Some aquatic ecosystems have been slow to recover from selenium contamination episodes. In recent years, non-governmental researchers have been proposing relatively high selenium thresholds in diet and tissue relative to those proposed by governmental researchers. This difference in opinions is due in part to the selection of datasets and caveats in selecting scientific literature. In spite of the growing selenium literature, there are needs for additional research on neglected organisms. This review also discusses the interaction of selenium with other elements, inconsistent effects of selenium on survival and growth of fish, and differences in depuration rates and sensitivity among species. },

@article{Hung1995,
	Abstract = {Analytical methods of dissolved Se species in river water and seawater were established and applied to study dissolved Se speciation in the Kaoping and Erhjen rivers and estuaries, southwestern Taiwan. The Kaoping and Erhjen rivers and estuaries were respectively in relatively oxygenated and oxygen-deficient conditions as revealed from the distributions of dissolved oxygen, DOC, nutrients, and dissolved Mn. Concentrations of dissolved total Se increased downstream in the riverine sections, ranging from 0.6 nM to 1.2 nM for the Kaoping River and from 0.8 nM to 1.05 nM for the Erhjen River. The dissolved total Se was only slightly higher in the Erhjen middle estuary than in the Kaoping middle estuary in spite of heavier pollution in the former. The dissolved total Se behaved rather conservatively in the Kaoping estuary but nonconservatively in the Erhjen estuary resulting from anthropogenic inputs, and in this respect showed similarities with the behavior of redox-sensitive Mn. The predominant species of selenium were Se(VI) and organic Se in the Kaoping River and Se(VI) in the Kaoping estuary. The elevated concentration of Se(VI) in the Kaoping estuary may stem from the degradation of organic Se and oxidation of Se(IV). On the other hand, Se(IV) and organic Se were equally dominant in the Erhjen River, and Se(IV) was predominant through most of the Erhjen estuary. The elevated distribution of Se(IV) in the Erhjen middle estuary may result mostly from partial decomposition of organic Se, but further oxidation of Se(IV) was inhibited in reducing waters. However, Se(VI) became dominant at Erhjen outer estuary where water was oxygenated by the replacement of intruded coastal seawater. Apparently, the speciation of dissolved Se was mainly controlled by the biological and redox processes in the Kaoping and Erhjen rivers and estuaries.},

The degree of mobility or cycling rate of selenium in an aquatic ecosystem will largely determine whether toxicity occurs and how long the environmental hazard remains. The selenium cycle is made up of immobilization and mobilization processes that move the element between organisms, water, and sediment, with kinetics determined by chemical and physical factors related to the type of habitat present and its spatial variability. Because of its ability to bioaccumulate and cause adverse reproductive effects at low environmental concentrations, selenium should be recognized as a contaminant with the potential to severely impact fish and wildlife populations.},

@article{Tinggi2003,
	Abstract = {Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element for animals and humans because of its role in an antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase. This enzyme protects cell membranes from damage caused by the peroxidation of lipids. The paper provides an overview of the effects of Se toxicity and deficiency in humans and animals. It is well established that Se deficiency causes health implications in humans and animals. Se is also very toxic and can cause Se poisoning (selenosis) in humans and animals. In Australia, Se deficiency has caused health problem to livestock; however, the problems were eliminated after the introduction of Se supplementation. Se toxicity has also been reported in some regions of Australia as a result of livestock feeding on Se accumulative plant species. The major source of Se is diet, and in many regions of the world the levels of Se in the soils generally reflect the Se status in human populations. In foods, the bioavailability and toxicity of Se depend on its chemical forms. Generally, organic forms of Se are more bioavailable and less toxic than the inorganic forms (selenites, selenates). The Se status in the Australian population and how this is compared with the rest of the world is also discussed.},
