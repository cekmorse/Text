\section{Water Balance Methods for Estimating NPS Return Flows to Streams}
\label{sec:water balance methods}

The basic water balance model is based the simple premise that the change in the volume of stored water is equal to the volume of the water entering the storage area less the volume of water leaving the storage area as show in equation \todoe .  The expanded form of the equation introduces the complexity involved with any water balance model.

\begin{gather}
\text{Inputs }-\text{ Outputs }=\text{ Change in storage}\nonumber\\
P\:+\:R\:+\:B\:-\:F\:-\:E\:-\:T\:=\:\Delta S
\end{gather}

For a full water balance model, equation xx \todoe becomes much more complex when we define the parameters storage, inflow, and outflow.  A common  water balance model defines the storage area as the area within a water basin (watershed) or waterbody such as a pond or lake \todoc.  The storage area we are considering is only the area within the river channel with the boundary defined as the soil/water interface.

Water balance models are essentially water mass balance models.  In this case, all of the elements of equation \todoe are in units of mass.  The density of liquid water in normal environmental conditions does not change enough to warrant the inclusion of density changes, allowing for the direct exchange of the units of mass for units of volume in equation \todoe .

Ditch seepage assessments.

- use of upstream and downstream flow measurements to calculate loss between the two points.  Evaporation is not included due to the short time scale.

Lake and pond water balance models.

- use of discharging stream flow mesurements and lake surface elevation measurement.  Evaporation is included.

- evaporation calculated using a number of methods.  Evaporation is found to be a significant factor in shallow lakes with large surface areas and in lakes in dry environments.
