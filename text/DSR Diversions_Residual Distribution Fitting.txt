Test Statistics for Scaled Residuals from DSR Diversions


Logistic distribution

Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic:  0.04018207 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test:  not rejected 
   The result of this test may be too conservative as it  
   assumes that the distribution parameters are known
Cramer-von Mises statistic:  0.01951093 
Cramer-von Mises test:  not rejected 
Anderson-Darling statistic:  0.1118016 
Anderson-Darling test:  not rejected 

Normal distribution

Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic:  0.04265205 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test:  not rejected 
   The result of this test may be too conservative as it  
   assumes that the distribution parameters are known
Cramer-von Mises statistic:  0.04982298 
Cramer-von Mises test:  not rejected 
Anderson-Darling statistic:  0.3194668 
Anderson-Darling test:  not rejected
