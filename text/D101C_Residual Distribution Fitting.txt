Test Statistics for Scaled Residuals from D101C


Logistic distribution

Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic:  0.0927875 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test:  not rejected 
   The result of this test may be too conservative as it  
   assumes that the distribution parameters are known

Anderson-Darling test:  not rejected 

Normal distribution

Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic:  0.09016918 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test:  not rejected 
   The result of this test may be too conservative as it  
   assumes that the distribution parameters are known
