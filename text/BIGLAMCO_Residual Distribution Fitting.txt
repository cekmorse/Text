Test Statistics for Residuals from BIGLAMCO


Logistic distribution

Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic:  0.1032584 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test:  not rejected 
   The result of this test may be too conservative as it  
   assumes that the distribution parameters are known
Cramer-von Mises statistic:  0.08185454 
Cramer-von Mises test:  not rejected 
Anderson-Darling statistic:  0.5082658 
Anderson-Darling test:  not rejected 

Normal distribution

Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic:  0.09188257 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test:  not rejected 
   The result of this test may be too conservative as it  
   assumes that the distribution parameters are known
