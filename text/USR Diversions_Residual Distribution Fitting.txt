Test Statistics for Scaled Residuals from USR Diversions


Logistic distribution

Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic:  0.04141218 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test:  not rejected 
   The result of this test may be too conservative as it  
   assumes that the distribution parameters are known
Cramer-von Mises statistic:  0.03226765 
Cramer-von Mises test:  not rejected 
Anderson-Darling statistic:  0.3521315 
Anderson-Darling test:  not rejected 

Normal distribution

Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic:  0.1093521 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test:  not rejected 
   The result of this test may be too conservative as it  
   assumes that the distribution parameters are known
Cramer-von Mises statistic:  0.3536651 
Cramer-von Mises test:  rejected 
Anderson-Darling statistic:  2.465536 
Anderson-Darling test:  rejected
